Template for octophonic speaker setting in 4010 with ReaSurroundPan

For the correct speaker arrangement in Studio 4010, load the preset ‘ReaSurroundPan-8ch-4010.RPL’ directly into the plugin.

The default number of input tracks is 8.
To increase the number of channels moving in space increase the number of „input channels“ in the ReaSurroundPan Plugin of the MASTER track.

To change the distribution of the sound source to the neighbouring speakers, select ‘Divergence’ under ‘Gain/LFE/Diverge/Delay’ at the bottom of the plugin and change the value of the corresponding track either using the slider directly above it or by entering a value on the right-hand side. 0 means no dispersion, 100 means maximum dispersion. (In this template, the default value is 1).
